Sales Prediction Using Linear Regression
Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to perform sales prediction using linear regression. It utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning and pandas for data manipulation. The dataset used for this example contains information about advertising expenditures on TV and Radio and their corresponding sales figures. The goal is to build a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following requirements:

Python installed (version 3.6 or later).
Required Python libraries installed, including pandas, scikit-learn.
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Ensure you have the necessary dataset available. In this example, the dataset is loaded from a CSV file named Sales.csv. You can replace it with your own dataset or modify the code to load the data from a different source.

Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Run the script by executing the following command:

Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of the Python script.

The script will load the dataset, perform data preprocessing (removing missing values and duplicates), split the data into training and testing sets, build a linear regression model, and calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the predictions.

The MSE value will be displayed in the terminal, indicating the model's performance in predicting sales based on advertising spending.

Customization
You can customize the script to load your own dataset by changing the file path in the line: a = pd.read_csv("./data/Sales.csv").

Adjust the features used for prediction by modifying the X variable. In this example, the script uses 'TV' and 'Radio' as features.

You can change the target variable by modifying the y variable. In this case, it's 'Sales'.

Tweak the train-test split ratio by adjusting the test_size parameter in the train_test_split function.
